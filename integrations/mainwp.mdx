## Enabling MainWP

<Warning>
  **MainWP Integration Notice:** Don't forget to install and activate the MainWP Child plugin in your template before uploading it or install it after the template creation for a proper integration.\
  \
  **Important Settings:** After installing MainWP Child plugin, make sure to disable "Require Password Authentication" and set "Connection Timeout" to 0 in the plugin settings for a seamless integration.
</Warning>

You can enable it **free of charge** under [General Setup] \> [General Overview] \> [MainWP Integration]

Once done it will automatically check if the "**MainWP dashboard**" already exists or not in your system.\
If it doesn't click on the button displayed:

<img
  src="/images/mainwp_dash.png"
  alt="Mainwp Dash Pn"
  title="Mainwp Dash Pn"
  style={{ width:"57%" }}
/>

The system will now redirect you to the templates page and will create it automatically for you (wait up to 60 secs to get it installed)

1. Click now on "**MainWP API**" and create an API key. For further information please refer to the official documentation: https://mainwp.com/kb/mainwp-rest-api/

   <img
     src="/images/mainwp_api.png"
     alt="Mainwp Api Pn"
     title="Mainwp Api Pn"
     style={{ width:"59%" }}
   />
2. Copy the **API key** (Bearer token) to a safe location and paste it in the **MainWP REST API Token** tab of your platform settings: [General Setup] \> [General Overview] \> [MainWP Integration]
3. You're done\! You can access now MainWP dashboard directly from your left menu and all of your new clients/websites will be automatically synchronized.

   <Note>
     If there are existing websites make sure to install **MainWP child** plugin manually on each of them before running the **Sync All** button.
