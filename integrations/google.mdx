## Enabling reCAPTCHA

The platform already comes with a basic captcha system, though if you want to enforce it and use a stronger version you can opt for Google reCAPTCHA by enabling it directly here.\
Make sure to create first the API keys:\
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create?hl=it\\\\
\
Then paste respectively the **Site Key** and **Secret Key** before saving.

It's all set now\! You'll see the reCAPTCHA during the registration form for your clients.
