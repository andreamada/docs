## Google Ads Integration

Track conversions and enable remarketing campaigns for your hosting platform.

### What is Google Ads?

Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is Google's online advertising platform. By integrating Google Ads, you can:

- Track conversions from your advertising campaigns
- Measure ROI on your ad spend
- Create remarketing audiences
- Optimize campaigns based on actual sales data

### Configuration

| Setting | Description | Format |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Google Ads Conversion ID** | Your Google Ads account conversion tracking ID | `AW-XXXXXXXXXX` |
| **Google Ads Conversion Label** | Specific conversion action label | Alphanumeric string |

### Getting Your Google Ads Credentials

1. Log in to your [Google Ads account](https://ads.google.com)
2. Navigate to **Tools & Settings → Measurement → Conversions**
3. Click **+ New Conversion Action**
4. Select **Website** as the conversion source
5. Configure your conversion action (e.g., "Purchase", "Sign Up")
6. Click **Create and Continue**
7. Copy your **Conversion ID** (format: `AW-XXXXXXXXXX`)
8. Copy your **Conversion Label** from the tracking code
9. Paste both values into your platform's Google integration settings

### Setting Up Conversion Tracking

1. Create a conversion action in Google Ads for key events:
   - Website purchases
   - Account registrations
   - Package upgrades
   - Domain registrations

2. Enter your Conversion ID and Label in the integration settings

3. The platform will automatically fire conversion events when:
   - Customers complete a purchase
   - New accounts are created
   - Subscriptions are activated

4. Verify conversions are tracking in Google Ads → Tools → Conversions

<Tip>
**Multiple Conversions:** Create separate conversion actions for different events (purchases, signups, upgrades) to track each independently. Use different conversion labels for each action.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Conversion Value:** The platform automatically sends the transaction value to Google Ads, allowing you to track revenue and calculate ROI accurately.

## Google reCAPTCHA

Protect your platform from spam, bots, and automated abuse with Google reCAPTCHA.

### What is reCAPTCHA?

Google reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis to distinguish humans from bots.

**reCAPTCHA Versions:**

- **reCAPTCHA v2:** "I'm not a robot" checkbox
- **reCAPTCHA v3:** Invisible, scores user interactions (recommended)

### Configuration

| Setting | Description | Format |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **reCAPTCHA Site Key** | Public key for your domain | Alphanumeric string (40 chars) |
| **reCAPTCHA Secret Key** | Private key for verification | Alphanumeric string (40 chars) |
| **reCAPTCHA Version** | v2 or v3 | Select from dropdown |

### Getting reCAPTCHA Keys

1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Click **+** to create a new site
3. Enter a **Label** (e.g., "My Hosting Platform")
4. Select **reCAPTCHA type**:
   - **reCAPTCHA v3** (recommended for seamless UX)
   - **reCAPTCHA v2** ("I'm not a robot" checkbox)
5. Add your **Domains** (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
6. Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service
7. Click **Submit**
8. Copy your **Site Key** (public)
9. Copy your **Secret Key** (private)
10. Paste both keys into your platform's Google integration settings

### Where reCAPTCHA is Applied

reCAPTCHA protects the following forms:

- **Registration:** New account signup
- **Login:** User authentication
- **Contact Form:** Customer inquiries
- **Password Reset:** Account recovery
- **Checkout:** Payment processing

<Warning>
**Secret Key Security:** Keep your reCAPTCHA Secret Key confidential. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. It's used server-side to verify reCAPTCHA responses.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**reCAPTCHA v3 Recommended:** Use reCAPTCHA v3 for better user experience. It works invisibly in the background and only challenges suspicious traffic. v2 requires user interaction for every submission.
</Tip>
