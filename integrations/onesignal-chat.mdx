## Enabling Live Chat

You can enable it under [Marketing Tools] \> [Integrations Setup] \> [Chat Online]

If enabled live chat option will appear in the bottom right of your platform and will allow your clients to interact directly with you.

<Note>
  It requires the CMS to be enabled/activated otherwise it won't work if you use an existing website
</Note>

You can indeed manage live chats directly from your agency website (Landing CMS) and start replying to your clients.

## Enabling Push Notifications

Web push notifications are notifications that can be sent to a user via desktop and mobile web. These alert-style messages slide in at the top or bottom right-hand corner of a desktop screen, depending on the operating system, or appear on a mobile device in a manner nearly identical to push notifications delivered from apps. Website push notifications are delivered on a user’s desktop or mobile screen whenever their browser is open — whether or not the user is on the website.

We did an integration with **OneSignal** to make this possible.\
All you need to do is retrieving the \*\*App ID \*\*and paste it directly in  [Marketing Tools] \> [Integrations Setup] \> [Chat Online]\
https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/keys-and-ids#app-id

After that you'll be able to manage your push notifications directly from \*\*OneSignal \*\*dashboard.
