## Builder Folder Update

### What is Builder Folder?

The builder folder contains WordPress core files (`wp-admin`, `wp-includes`, and core PHP files) that are synchronized across all websites. This centralized approach ensures consistency and simplifies updates.

**Update Path:**
- **From:** `{SYSTEM_ROOT}/builder/wordpress-includes`
- **To:** `/home/*/domains/*/public_html/builder`

### Updating Builder Folders

1. Click **Update Builder Folders** button
2. System synchronizes WordPress core files to all websites
3. Updates apply to:
   - Template websites
   - Client websites
   - All WordPress installations

<Warning>
**Critical Operation:** Builder folder updates affect ALL WordPress websites on your platform. Ensure you have backups before proceeding.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**When to Update:** Update builder folders after downloading a new WordPress version or when you need to apply security patches across all sites.
</Tip>
