## User IP Assignments

### Viewing User IPs

The user IP list displays all customer accounts with their assigned IPs:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Checkbox** | Select for bulk operations |
| **ID** | User account ID |
| **User Information** | Name and email address |
| **DA User / IP** | DirectAdmin username and assigned IP |
| **Domains** | List of domains owned by user |

### Filtering Users

**Search by Domain:**
- Enter domain name in search field
- Results filter in real-time
- Searches across all user domains

**Filter by IP Address:**
- Select IP from dropdown
- Shows only users on that IP
- Displays user count per IP
- Default IP marked with ⭐ star

<Tip>
**Quick Identification:** The default IP is marked with a star (⭐) in the filter dropdown, making it easy to identify your primary IP address.
</Tip>

## IP Configuration

### Server Information

Displays current server configuration:
- **Server IP:** Primary server IP address
- **Active IPs:** Total number of available IPs
- **Network Status:** Current network state

### Default IP Settings

Set the default IP address for new user accounts:

1. View list of available IPs
2. See user count for each IP
3. Select radio button for desired default IP
4. Click **Save IP Configuration**
5. New users will be assigned to this IP

**IP Information Displayed:**
- IP address
- Number of users currently assigned
- Default IP indicator (star icon)

<Info>
**Default IP Purpose:** The default IP is automatically assigned to new user accounts when they are created. This helps distribute users across available IPs.
</Info>

## Bulk IP Operations

### Moving Users Between IPs

Transfer multiple users from one IP to another:

1. **Select Users:**
   - Check individual users
   - Or use "Check All" to select all

2. **Choose Target IP:**
   - Select new IP from "Switch selected users to IP" dropdown
   - View user count for each IP to balance load

3. **Process Transfer:**
   - System processes users sequentially
   - Status updates for each user
   - Automatic DirectAdmin account migration

<Warning>
**Migration Impact:** Moving users between IPs requires DirectAdmin account reconfiguration. This may cause brief service interruption for affected users.
</Warning>

### Sync IP from Server

Synchronize IP assignments from DirectAdmin:

1. Click **Sync IP from Server** button
2. System queries DirectAdmin for each user
3. Updates database with current IP assignments
4. Displays sync status for each user

**Sync Process:**
- Retrieves actual IP from DirectAdmin
- Updates platform database
- Verifies DirectAdmin account exists
- Shows success/error for each user

---

## DirectAdmin Integration

### How IP Assignment Works

**User Creation:**
1. New user account created in platform
2. DirectAdmin account created automatically
3. User assigned to default IP
4. IP stored in user storage data

**IP Migration:**
1. User selected for IP change
2. DirectAdmin API called to move account
3. Account recreated on new IP
4. Database updated with new IP

**Sync Operation:**
1. Platform queries DirectAdmin
2. Retrieves current IP for each user
3. Compares with database
4. Updates mismatches

<Info>
**DirectAdmin Username:** Each user has a DirectAdmin username stored in their account. This is used for all server operations and IP management.

2. Configure IP settings
3. Assign IP to admin account
4. Verify IP is accessible

**In Platform:**
1. IP appears automatically in dropdown
2. Set as default if desired
3. Begin assigning users to new IP
4. Monitor IP usage

### Balancing IP Load

**Review Current Distribution:**
1. Check user count per IP in filter dropdown
2. Identify overloaded IPs

5. Verify migration successful

**Monitoring:**
- Track users per IP
- Monitor server load per IP
- Review bandwidth usage
- Check for IP-specific issues
