## Platform Architecture

### Single Tenant Infrastructure

<Info>
**AreaWP uses a Single Tenant architecture** - providing dedicated, isolated resources for each website. This architectural choice ensures superior performance, security, and customization capabilities compared to multi-tenant or WordPress Multisite approaches.
</Info>

**Why Single Tenant?**

AreaWP has deliberately chosen the single tenant approach because it delivers the best experience for both platform owners and end users:

**🚀 Superior Performance**
- Each website has dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
- No resource competition between sites
- Faster load times since resources aren't shared
- Predictable performance regardless of other sites' activity

**🔒 Enhanced Security**
- Complete isolation between websites
- No cross-site contamination risk
- Database issues don't cascade across sites
- Each site can have independent security configurations

**⚙️ Maximum Flexibility**
- Independent WordPress versions per site
- Custom plugins and themes for each website
- Site-specific configurations and optimizations
- Update sites individually without affecting others

**🎯 Easier Management**
- Isolated troubleshooting (issues don't affect other sites)
- Independent backups and restores
- Granular control over each website
- Simpler debugging and maintenance

### Architecture Comparison

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Tenant (Our Approach)">
    **Dedicated Resources Per Website**
    
    Each website operates independently with:
    - ✅ Separate WordPress installation
    - ✅ Dedicated database
    - ✅ Isolated file system
    - ✅ Independent configuration
    - ✅ No shared resources
    
    **Perfect For:**
    - Agencies managing diverse client websites
    - Sites requiring custom configurations
    - High-security requirements
    - Maximum performance needs
    - Professional WaaS platforms
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi Tenant">
    **Shared Infrastructure**
    
    Multiple websites share:
    - ⚠️ Single WordPress codebase
    - ⚠️ Shared database (prefixed tables)
    - ⚠️ Common plugins/themes
    - ⚠️ Unified configuration
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Limited customization per site
    - Performance degradation under load
    - Security risks from shared infrastructure
    - Complex database management
    - Updates affect all sites simultaneously
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="WordPress Multisite">
    **Network of Sites**
    
    One WordPress installation managing multiple sites:
    - ⚠️ Single database with prefixed tables
    - ⚠️ Shared plugins and themes
    - ⚠️ Network-wide settings
    - ⚠️ Subdomains or subdirectories
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Weakest isolation model
    - Database issues cascade across network
    - Limited per-site customization
    - Complex plugin compatibility
    - Not suitable for client websites
