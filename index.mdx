## Single Tenant vs Multi Tenant

In a multi-tenant WordPress setup, a single WordPress installation serves multiple websites (or tenants), each with its own isolated space and data. In contrast, a single-tenant WordPress setup provides a dedicated WordPress installation for each website, with its own database, files, and resources. 

**Overall:**\
**Single tenant (our choice):** More secure since each customer has a separate environment. A security breach only affects one client.

**Multi tenant**: Higher risk because multiple customers share the same infrastructure. If one tenant is compromised, others might be at risk.

That's why we opted for **"single tenant"** deployment for our infrastructure.
