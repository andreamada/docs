## Platform Architecture

### Single Tenant vs Multi Tenant

Understanding the architecture model is crucial for choosing the right deployment:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single Tenant (Recommended)">
    **Dedicated Infrastructure**
    
    Each AreaWP installation runs on its own dedicated server with isolated resources.
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Complete resource isolation
    - Enhanced security and privacy
    - Full control over server configuration
    - Predictable performance
    - No "noisy neighbor" issues
    - Customizable server specifications
    
    **Best For:**
    - Agencies with 50+ clients
    - High-traffic websites
    - Enterprise clients
    - Security-sensitive applications
    - Custom infrastructure requirements
    
    **Available In:**
    - Self-Hosted Edition
    - Hosted Edition (VPS per customer)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multi Tenant">
    **Shared Infrastructure**
    
    Multiple AreaWP customers share the same server infrastructure with resource allocation.
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Lower initial cost
    - Easier to get started
    - Managed infrastructure
    - Automatic scaling
    - Reduced maintenance overhead
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Shared resources
    - Limited customization
    - Potential performance variability
    - Standard configurations
    
    **Best For:**
    - Small agencies (under 50 clients)
    - Startups and freelancers
    - Testing and development
    - Budget-conscious deployments
    
    **Available In:**
    - Hosted Edition only
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
**Recommendation:** For production environments with serious business requirements, we strongly recommend the **Single Tenant** architecture for optimal performance, security, and control.
