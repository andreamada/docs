title: "Technical Details (Managed)"
description: "Each managed platform is installed on a virtual private server (KVM virtualization) fully isolated and with resources dedicated to you and with DDoS protection enabled."
---

<Info>
  **Note**: There's no root access with the server to avoid unwanted operations and direct access to the source code of the platform itself.\
  We can provide a limited SSH account though upon request.
</Info>

## Tech Stack

By default,  all of these servers are spawned with Ubuntu OS and are optimized specifically for WordPress (LEMP stack, Fast-CGI cache, Redis):

1. LEMP stack (**Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP)**
2. Fast-Cgi cache
3. Redis

## DirectAdmin Control Panel

Please note that each platform comes with a \*\*DirectAdmin \*\*access as well which is installed on top of the platform to enhance security and provide better performance.

Here you can perform whatever operation you wish which is not natively integrated in the platform such as accessing your customers files via "**File Manager**", setup hourly/daily/weekly \*\*backups \*\*locally or in a offsite location etc.

## Autoscale Configuration

<Tip>
  Autoscale option available under the [Business](https://areawp.com/pricing) and [Enterprise ](https://areawp.com/pricing)plans only.
</Tip>

Autoscale refers to adding more resources such as CPU/RAM to your Virtual Machines based on a particular threshold as on demand. In Autoscale, resources can be upgraded when required and downgraded to original state when load goes below threshold.\
This ensures that the Virtual Machines donâ€™t loose their performance during peak load.\
This is automatically configured by us for you and triggers the server whenever CPU or RAM thresold **\>= 90%** by adding respectively 1 CPU or 1GB RAM.\
It's _free of charge_ and does not involve any other cost on your end.

## Uptime Monitor

<Tip>
  Uptime option available under the [Business](https://areawp.com/pricing) and [Enterprise ](https://areawp.com/pricing)plans only.
</Tip>

This feature allows you the possibility to get a custom and unique page where you can monitor the uptime of your own server as well as CPU, RAM, disk and network usage.

Take a look at the demo [here](https://status.areawp.com/report/uptime/61f2fe493612fd989206729c381f02c5/).

In addition you'll receive custom notifications via email whenever the virtual server exceeds 80% of its resources , so you can act promptly to fix the root cause or upgrade the server without causing downtime to the customer (remember that you will still have the "autoscale" that will cover you temporarily from any possible downtime)

## Blacklist Monitor

<Tip>
  Blacklist option available under the [Enterprise ](https://areawp.com/pricing)plan only.
</Tip>

This feature will alert you via email whenever your server's IP gets blacklisted in any popular RBL with a check that is performed automatically every 24 hours.
