  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2.4 Configure SSL Certificate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Up Wildcard SSL with Cloudflare" icon="lock">
    **Enable HTTPS for All Subdomains**
    
    AreaWP creates client sites as subdomains, so a wildcard SSL certificate is highly recommended. This guide shows how to set up a free Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate using Cloudflare DNS.
    
    <Info>
    **Why Wildcard SSL?** A wildcard certificate (*.yourdomain.com) automatically secures all subdomains including client1.yourdomain.com, client2.yourdomain.com, etc., without needing individual certificates.
    </Info>
    
    ---
    
    **Step 1: Generate Cloudflare API Credentials**
    
    First, you need to create API credentials in Cloudflare:
    
    1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
    2. Ensure your domain is added to Cloudflare and DNS is active
    3. Click on your **Profile Icon** (top right) → **My Profile**
    4. Navigate to **API Tokens** tab
    5. Click **Create Token**
    
    **Token Configuration:**
    
    6. Use the **"Edit zone DNS"** template or create custom token
    7. Set the following permissions:
       - **Permissions:**
         - Zone → DNS → Edit
         - Zone → Zone → Read
       - **Zone Resources:**
         - Include → Specific zone → Select your domain
    8. Click **Continue to summary**
    9. Review and click **Create Token**
    10. **Copy and save the API Token** - you'll need it in DirectAdmin
    
    <Warning>
    **Important:** Save the API token immediately - Cloudflare only shows it once! Store it securely.
    </Warning>
    
    **Get Your Global API Key (Alternative):**
    
    If you prefer using the Global API Key instead:
    
    1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, go to **My Profile** → **API Tokens**
    2. Scroll down to **API Keys** section
    3. Click **View** next to "Global API Key"
    4. Enter your Cloudflare password to reveal the key
    5. Copy and save both:
       - Your Cloudflare account email
       - The Global API Key
    
    ---
    
    **Step 2: Configure SSL in DirectAdmin**
    
    Now set up the wildcard SSL certificate in DirectAdmin:
    
    1. Log in to DirectAdmin as **reseller user** (`awp`)
    2. Navigate to **Account Manager** → **SSL Certificates**
    3. Click **Get automatic certificate from ACME Provider**
    
    **ACME Configuration:**
    
    4. Select **Certificate Type:**
       - Choose **"Wildcard"** (covers *.yourdomain.com)
    
    5. **DNS Provider Settings:**
       - DNS Provider: Select **"Cloudflare"** from dropdown
    
    6. **Enter Cloudflare Credentials:**
       
       **Option A - Using API Token (Recommended):**
       - **API Token:** Paste the token you created in Step 1
       - Leave API Key and Email fields empty
       
       **Option B - Using Global API Key:**
       - **API Key:** Paste your Global API Key
       - **Email:** Enter your Cloudflare account email
       - Leave API Token field empty
    
    7. **Domain Configuration:**
       - **Domain:** Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
       - The certificate will cover both `yourdomain.com` and `*.yourdomain.com`
    
    8. Click **Request Certificate**
    
    **Verification Process:**
    
    9. DirectAdmin will:
       - Contact Let's Encrypt ACME server
       - Create a DNS TXT record in Cloudflare automatically
       - Verify domain ownership
       - Issue the wildcard SSL certificate
       - Install the certificate automatically
    
    10. Wait for completion (usually 1-2 minutes)
    
    11. You should see a success message confirming the certificate installation
    
    ---
    
    **Step 3: Verify SSL Installation**

    
    **Test in Browser:**
    1. Visit `https://yourdomain.com`
    2. Click the padlock icon
    3. View certificate details
    4. Confirm it shows `*.yourdomain.com` in Subject Alternative Names
    
    ---
    
    **Auto-Renewal Configuration**
    
    Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days. DirectAdmin handles auto-renewal automatically:
    
    - Certificates are checked daily
    - Auto-renewal starts 30 days before expiration
    - Cloudflare API credentials are stored securely
    - No manual intervention required
    
    <Tip>
    **Renewal Monitoring:** Check DirectAdmin → SSL Certificates regularly to ensure auto-renewal is working. You'll receive email notifications if renewal fails.
    </Tip>
    
    ---
    
    **Troubleshooting**
    
    **Certificate Request Failed:**
    
    Common issues and solutions:
    
    1. **Invalid API Credentials:**
       - Verify API token is correct
       - Ensure token has DNS Edit permissions
       - Check token hasn't expired
    
    2. **DNS Not Propagated:**
       - Ensure domain is active in Cloudflare
       - Check nameservers point to Cloudflare
       - Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
    
    3. **Rate Limit Exceeded:**
       - Let's Encrypt has rate limits (5 certificates per domain per week)
       - Wait before retrying
       - Use staging environment for testing
    
    **Wildcard Not Covering Subdomains:**
    
    If subdomains show SSL errors:
    
    1. Verify certificate includes `*.yourdomain.com`
    2. Check subdomain DNS records exist
    3. Ensure Apache/Nginx is configured for wildcard
    4. Restart web server
    5. Clear browser cache
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alternative: Manual DNS Verification" icon="terminal">
    **Without Cloudflare API**
    
    If you prefer not to use Cloudflare API or use a different DNS provider:
    
    1. In DirectAdmin, request Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate
    2. DirectAdmin will provide a TXT record to add
    3. Manually add the TXT record to your DNS:
       - Name: `_acme-challenge.yourdomain.com`
       - Type: `TXT`
       - Value: (provided by DirectAdmin)
    4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)
    5. Return to DirectAdmin and verify
    6. Certificate will be issued and installed
    
    <Warning>
    **Manual Renewal:** With manual DNS verification, you'll need to repeat this process every 90 days for renewal. Cloudflare API method is recommended for automatic renewal.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alternative: Commercial SSL Certificate" icon="certificate">
    **Purchase Wildcard SSL**
    
    If you prefer a commercial SSL certificate:
    
    **Purchase Options:**
    - Sectigo/Comodo Wildcard SSL (~$100-200/year)
    - DigiCert Wildcard SSL (~$300-600/year)
    - GoDaddy Wildcard SSL (~$300/year)
    
    **Installation:**
    1. Purchase wildcard certificate for `*.yourdomain.com`
    2. Generate CSR in DirectAdmin
    3. Submit CSR to certificate authority
    4. Receive certificate files
    5. Install via DirectAdmin SSL Manager
    6. Upload certificate, private key, and CA bundle
    
    **Advantages:**
    - Extended validation options
    - Longer validity periods
    - Commercial support
    - Higher trust indicators

    5. Click **Create**
    6. **Save the generated key** - you'll need it during installation
    
    <Warning>
    **Security:** Keep this login key secure. It provides full access to DirectAdmin API. Never share it or commit it to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2.6 Configure Sudo Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Grant Sudo Access" icon="user-shield">
    **Allow AreaWP to Execute System Commands**
    
    AreaWP needs sudo permissions to manage WordPress files and execute server commands.
    
    **Edit Sudoers File:**
    
    1. Connect to your server via SSH as root:
       ```bash
       ssh root@your-server-ip
       ```
    
    2. Edit the sudoers file:
       ```bash
       visudo
       ```
    
    3. Add the following line at the **end of the file**:
       ```bash
       awp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
       ```
       
       Replace `awp` with your actual reseller username if different.
    
    4. Save and exit:
       - Press `Ctrl + X`
       - Press `Y` to confirm
       - Press `Enter` to save
    
    5. Verify the configuration:
       ```bash
       sudo -l -U awp
       ```
    
    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    User awp may run the following commands on this host:
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    **Security Consideration:** This grants full sudo access to the reseller user. Ensure this user is only used for AreaWP operations and is properly secured with a strong password.
