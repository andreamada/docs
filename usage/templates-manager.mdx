## Template Synchronization

Template Synchronization is a powerful feature that allows you to automatically push updates from a master template to all websites created from it.

### How Template Synchronization Works

When enabled, any changes made to the master template are automatically synchronized to all websites that:
1. Were created from this template
2. Have synchronization enabled on their website settings

**What Gets Synchronized:**
- **Theme Files:** Template files, stylesheets, and assets
- **Plugin Changes:** Plugin installations, updates, and removals
- **Configuration:** Theme settings and customizations
- **Content Updates:** Template pages and posts (optional)
- **Widget Configurations:** Sidebar and widget settings

<Info>
**New Feature:** Template Synchronization helps you maintain consistency across multiple websites and deploy updates efficiently without manually updating each site.
</Info>

### Enabling Template Synchronization

**On the Template:**

1. Edit the template in Template Manager
2. Enable **Template Synchronization** toggle
3. Configure sync settings:
   - **Sync Frequency:** Real-time, Hourly, Daily, Manual
   - **Sync Scope:** Files only, Files + Plugins, Full sync
   - **Backup Before Sync:** Create backup before applying changes
4. Save template settings

**On Individual Websites:**

Customers or admins can enable/disable sync per website:
1. Go to website settings
2. Enable **Sync with Template** option
3. Website will receive template updates automatically

<Tip>
**Selective Sync:** Websites can opt-out of synchronization if they need custom modifications. This gives flexibility while maintaining the option to sync when needed.
</Tip>

### Use Cases for Template Synchronization

**1. Agency/Multi-Site Management:**
- Maintain consistent branding across client websites
- Deploy security updates to all sites instantly
- Roll out new features to all clients simultaneously
- Standardize plugin configurations

**2. SaaS/Multi-Tenant Platforms:**
- Update all customer sites with new features
- Fix bugs across all instances at once
- Maintain template consistency
- Reduce maintenance overhead

**3. Franchise/Branch Websites:**
- Keep all franchise locations consistent
- Update corporate branding across all sites
- Deploy compliance changes instantly
- Maintain brand standards

**4. Educational Institutions:**
- Standardize department websites
- Update institutional branding
- Deploy accessibility improvements
- Maintain consistent navigation

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sync Safety Features

<Warning>
**Custom Modifications:** Websites with custom theme modifications may have those changes overwritten by template sync. Always backup before enabling sync, or exclude customized websites from synchronization.
</Warning>

### Managing Synchronized Websites
