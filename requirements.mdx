title: "Requirements"
---

Please do **NOT install** services such as **Apache, PHP, MySQL, Ftp, Sendmail**, etc. All you need is a CLEAN install of your operating system with **DirectAdmin** installed.\
You can refer to the official documentation to proceed with the installation:\
https://docs.directadmin.com/getting-started/installation/installguide.html

<Note>
  If you purchase the "Self-Hosted" edition, **DirectAdmin** license is already integrated by default.\
  No additional license purchase is required on your end.
</Note>

We strongly do **not** recommend installing DirectAdmin on an existing **live production server** or on the server where any other **Control Panel is already installed**.

Please note that you must have **root access** on the server.

### Hardware

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Self-Hosted Edition" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    We highly recommend a processor of at least 500 Mhz even though DirectAdmin will run on slower systems. The more cores the better.

    A minimum 4 GB of memory is required, with **at least 4 GB of swap memory**.

    A hard drive with at least 2 gigabytes of free space (after the Linux install) is also required, not including any website data.

    If you are expecting high traffic levels then you will need more memory, processor power, and hard drive space than we recommend here.

  <Accordion title="Hosted Edition" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    We spawn and configure the virtual machine for you, no actions are required on your end.\
    Sit back, relax and enjoy your journey\! :)
