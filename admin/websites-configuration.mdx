## Resource Allocation

Configure default disk space and bandwidth limits for new websites.

| Setting | Range | Recommended |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Disk Space (MB)** | 150 - 99,999,999,999 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| **Bandwidth (MB/month)** | 150 - 99,999,999,999 | 10,000 - 50,000 |
| **Bandwidth Warning (%)** | 0 - 100 | 80% |

<Tip>
Start with conservative limits and increase based on actual usage patterns. Monitor resource consumption regularly and adjust limits to match your hosting capacity and customer needs.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Bandwidth Warning:** When a website reaches the specified percentage of its bandwidth limit, the system will send a notification to the website owner, allowing them to upgrade before hitting the limit.
</Info>

## User Limitations

Control how many websites users can create and how frequently.

| Setting | Description | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Max Websites per User** | Total websites allowed | 5-10 for standard users |
| **Creation Delay (seconds)** | Wait time between creations | 60-300 seconds |
| **Threshold Limit** | Concurrent creations | 1 (one at a time) |

<Warning>
**Security vs. User Experience:** Balance security with user experience. Too restrictive limits may frustrate legitimate users, while too lenient limits may allow abuse. Monitor creation patterns and adjust accordingly.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Set creation delays to prevent automated abuse while allowing legitimate users to create multiple websites. Consider offering higher limits for premium customers or verified accounts.
</Tip>

## Trial & Expiry Settings

Configure trial periods and expiration handling for websites.

| Setting | Range | Recommended |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Trial Period (days)** | 1-365 (0 = disabled) | 7-30 days |
| **Delete After Expiry (days)** | 0-365 (0 = immediate) | 7-14 days |
| **Default Expiry (days)** | 1-365 | 30 days |

**Expiration Flow:**
1. Website reaches expiration date
2. Website is suspended/disabled
3. Grace period begins (Delete After Expiration)
4. If not renewed, permanently deleted

<Warning>
**Data Loss Prevention:** Ensure customers are aware of expiration policies. Send multiple reminders before expiration. Provide adequate grace period for renewals. Back up data before permanent deletion.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Offer a 7-14 day grace period after expiration to allow customers time to renew. Send expiration reminders at 30, 14, 7, and 1 day before expiration. Consider offering easy renewal options.
</Tip>

---

## Branding Assets

Customize the website creation experience with your branding.

**Website Setup Image**

Custom image displayed during website creation.

- **Size**: 1200 x 600 pixels
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, GIF
- **Max Size**: 2 MB
- **Use**: Branding during setup

<Tip>
Use high-quality images that reflect your brand identity. Ensure images are optimized for web to maintain fast loading times. Test images on different screen sizes for responsiveness.
</Tip>

## Helpdesk Automation

Configure automatic ticket management to improve support efficiency.

| Setting | Range | Recommended |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Ticket Retention (days)** | 1-365 | 30-90 days |
| **Auto-Close Awaiting (days)** | 1-365 | 7-14 days |

**Auto-Close Process:**
1. Ticket status changes to "Awaiting Customer"
2. Auto-close countdown begins
3. If no customer response within specified days
4. System automatically closes ticket
5. Customer receives notification

<Info>
**Ticket Retention:** Closed tickets are kept for the specified retention period before being archived or deleted. This allows you to reference historical support interactions and maintain customer service records.
</Info>

<Tip>
Set auto-close to 7-14 days for "Awaiting Customer" tickets. Send a reminder 2 days before auto-closing. Allow customers to easily reopen closed tickets if needed.
</Tip>
