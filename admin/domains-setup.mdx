## Configuring Dynadot

These settings can be found under [Services Setup] \> [Domains Setup]

We added a Dynadot integration to allow you reselling domains to your final clients.\
In order to make it work you'll need first to create an API on their panel:\
https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/setting/api.html\\
\
Once done, paste it directly here:

  alt="Domains Setup Pn"
  title="Domains Setup Pn"
  style={{ width:"36%" }}
/>

### LTD Settings

In this tab you can define the LTD to check by default in the domain search as well as defining custom nameservers.

### Domains Pricing

If you wanna customize the price for domains setting up your own rate, you can do it under [Services Setup] \> [Website Plans] \> [Domains]
