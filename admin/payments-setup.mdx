## Creating a Payment Account

To create a Payment Account, visit [General Setup] \> [General Overview] \> [Payments Gateway]

### Bank Account

<Note>
  This is the only payment method that requires manual approval on your end once the payment is received
</Note>

Here you can define respectively:

- Bank account name
- Bank account holder (Full name)
- Bank account number (IBAN)
- Bank location

### Stripe Payment Gateway

Enable this option if you want to integrate Stripe as payment gateway.\
Make sure to follow the official documentation to create the API keys:\
https://docs.stripe.com/keys

Then fill the form respectively with the "**Publishable**" and "**Secret**" key.\
Once done add a webhook endpoint in Stripe:\
https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard/webhooks

1. URL Endpoint must be as follows:\
   [**https://YOURDOMAIN.COM/api/stripe/webhook**](https://YOURDOMAIN.COM/api/stripe/webhook)
2. Add the following event: **checkout.session.completed**
3. Fill the "**Stripe Webhook Secret**" with the key generated

### PayPal Payment Gateway

Enable this option to accept payments via PayPal.\
You'll need to create first of all the API to get started:\
https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/

\
To create these credentials, log into the **PayPal Developer Dashboard** using your business account. Navigate to "**Apps & Credentials**," create a new app, and PayPal will generate the Client ID and Secret Key for you.

<Note>
  Note: If you have a personal account with PayPal, youâ€™ll need to convert it to a business account to generate these codes.
</Note>

Once done paste the keys generated respectively in the appropriate fields.\
Select the "Mode" based on the one defined in PayPal (Sandbox for testing environment, Live for Production)
