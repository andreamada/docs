## User Roles

Define different user types with specific permissions and access levels.

### Default Roles

| Role | Typical Use | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Administrator** | Platform owners | Complete control |
| **Manager** | Team leads | Most features |
| **Support** | Customer service | Customer-facing features |
| **User** | Regular customers | Basic features only |
| **Guest** | Trial users | Minimal access |

### Creating Custom Roles

1. Click "Add Role" button in the User Roles section
2. Choose a descriptive name for the role (e.g., "Sales Team", "Technical Support")
3. Configure feature access by selecting appropriate permissions
4. Review all permissions to ensure they match the role's responsibilities
5. Save the role to make it available for assignment to users

<Tip>
**Role Design:** Create roles based on job functions and follow the principle of least privilege. Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their duties effectively.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Security:** Be cautious when granting administrative permissions. Too many administrators can create security risks and make it difficult to track changes. Limit admin access to trusted team members only.
</Warning>
