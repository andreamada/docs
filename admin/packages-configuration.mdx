## Renewal Terms

Configure billing periods and pricing for different subscription lengths. Renewal terms allow you to offer discounts for longer commitments, encouraging customers to subscribe for extended periods.

### How Renewal Terms Work

Renewal terms define the available billing cycles customers can choose when purchasing or renewing a hosting package. Each term has its own pricing, which can be discounted from the base monthly rate.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Base Price:** The monthly price of your hosting package (e.g., $10/month)
- **Billing Period:** How often customers are charged (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.)
- **Term Price:** The total amount charged for the entire billing period
- **Discount:** Percentage reduction from the regular price to encourage longer commitments

### Configuring Renewal Terms

1. Navigate to **Hosting Plans → Renewal Terms** section
2. For each billing period, set the price for that term
3. Calculate discounts based on your pricing strategy
4. Enable/disable specific terms based on your business model
5. Save configuration to make terms available to customers

**Available Billing Periods:**

| Period | Duration | Typical Discount | Use Case |
|--------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Monthly** | 1 month | 0% (base) | Flexibility, trial customers |
| **Quarterly** | 3 months | 5-10% | Short-term commitment |
| **Semi-Annual** | 6 months | 10-15% | Medium-term commitment |
| **Annual** | 12 months | 15-25% | Best value, recommended |
| **Biennial** | 24 months | 20-30% | Long-term commitment |
| **Triennial** | 36 months | 25-35% | Maximum savings |

### Pricing Examples

**Example 1: $10/month Base Package**

| Period | Calculation | Regular Price | Discounted Price | Savings |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 Month | $10 × 1 | $10 | $10 | 0% |
| 3 Months | $10 × 3 | $30 | $27 | 10% ($3) |
| 6 Months | $10 × 6 | $60 | $51 | 15% ($9) |
| 12 Months | $10 × 12 | $120 | $100 | 17% ($20) |
| 24 Months | $10 × 24 | $240 | $192 | 20% ($48) |

**Example 2: $25/month Professional Package**

| Period | Calculation | Regular Price | Discounted Price | Savings |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 Month | $25 × 1 | $25 | $25 | 0% |
| 3 Months | $25 × 3 | $75 | $68 | 10% ($7) |
| 12 Months | $25 × 12 | $300 | $250 | 17% ($50) |
| 24 Months | $25 × 24 | $600 | $480 | 20% ($120) |

### How Customers See Renewal Terms

When customers purchase a hosting package:

1. They select their desired hosting package (Starter, Professional, etc.)
2. They choose a billing period from available renewal terms
3. The system displays the total price and any savings
4. Upon purchase, they're charged the term price upfront
5. The service remains active for the entire billing period
6. At renewal, they're charged again for the same term (or can change)

<Info>
**Customer Choice:** Renewal terms give customers flexibility in how they pay. Monthly terms attract price-sensitive customers, while annual terms provide better revenue predictability and reduce churn.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Discount Strategy:** 
- Offer meaningful discounts for annual plans (15-25%) to encourage longer commitments
- Make annual plans the "best value" to drive conversions
- This improves cash flow and reduces customer churn
- Highlight annual savings prominently in your pricing display
- Consider offering 2-3 month free when paying annually
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Pricing Consistency:** Ensure renewal term pricing is consistent across all packages. If you change term pricing, it only affects new purchases—existing subscriptions continue at their original price until renewal.
</Warning>

## Global Service Pricing

Configure pricing for additional services available across all packages.

| Service | Typical Price | Billing |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **SSL Certificate** | $10-30 | Annual |
| **Backup Service** | $5-15 | Monthly |
| **Disk Upgrade (1GB)** | $1-5 | Monthly |
| **Disk Upgrade (5GB)** | $8 | Monthly |
| **Disk Upgrade (10GB)** | $15 | Monthly |

<Info>
**Service Addons:** These services can be purchased by customers on any plan. Price them to be profitable while remaining competitive with market rates.
</Info>

## Domain Pricing

Set registration and renewal prices for each TLD.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Registration Price** | New domain cost | $12.99/year |
| **Registration VAT** | Tax on registration | $2.60 (20%) |
| **Renewal Price** | Renewal cost | $14.99/year |
| **Renewal VAT** | Tax on renewal | $3.00 (20%) |

### Common TLD Pricing

| TLD | Registration | Renewal |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| .com | $12.99 | $14.99 |
| .net | $14.99 | $16.99 |
| .org | $13.99 | $15.99 |
| .io | $34.99 | $39.99 |
| .co | $24.99 | $29.99 |
| .app | $18.99 | $22.99 |
| .dev | $15.99 | $18.99 |

**Pricing Strategy:**
1. Check wholesale cost from registrar
2. Add margin (20-40%)
3. Round to .99 pricing
4. Set renewal slightly higher

<Tip>
**Domain Pricing:** Research competitor pricing for each TLD. Price popular TLDs (.com, .net) competitively. Add higher margins to premium TLDs (.io, .ai). Set renewals 10-20% higher than registration.
</Tip>
