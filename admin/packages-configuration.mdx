## Renewal Terms

Set pricing for different billing cycles with discounts for longer commitments.

| Period | Typical Discount | Use Case |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Monthly** | 0% (base) | Flexibility |
| **Quarterly** | 5-10% | Short-term |
| **Semi-Annual** | 10-15% | Medium-term |
| **Annual** | 15-25% | Best value |
| **Biennial** | 20-30% | Long-term |
| **Triennial** | 25-35% | Maximum savings |

**Example for $10/month package:**

| Period | Regular | Discounted | Savings |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1 Month | $10 | $10 | - |
| 3 Months | $30 | $27 | 10% |
| 12 Months | $120 | $100 | 17% |
| 24 Months | $240 | $192 | 20% |

<Tip>
**Discount Strategy:** Offer meaningful discounts for annual plans (15-25%) to encourage longer commitments. This improves cash flow and reduces churn. Highlight annual savings prominently.
</Tip>

## Global Service Pricing

Configure pricing for additional services available across all packages.

| Service | Typical Price | Billing |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **SSL Certificate** | $10-30 | Annual |

| **Disk Upgrade (5GB)** | $8 | Monthly |
| **Disk Upgrade (10GB)** | $15 | Monthly |

<Info>
**Service Addons:** These services can be purchased by customers on any plan. Price them to be profitable while remaining competitive with market rates.

## Domain Pricing

Set registration and renewal prices for each TLD.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Registration Price** | New domain cost | $12.99/year |
| **Registration VAT** | Tax on registration | $2.60 (20%) |
| **Renewal Price** | Renewal cost | $14.99/year |
| **Renewal VAT** | Tax on renewal | $3.00 (20%) |

### Common TLD Pricing

| TLD | Registration | Renewal |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| .com | $12.99 | $14.99 |
| .net | $14.99 | $16.99 |
| .org | $13.99 | $15.99 |
| .io | $34.99 | $39.99 |
| .co | $24.99 | $29.99 |
| .app | $18.99 | $22.99 |
| .dev | $15.99 | $18.99 |

**Pricing Strategy:**
1. Check wholesale cost from registrar
2. Add margin (20-40%)
3. Round to .99 pricing
4. Set renewal slightly higher

<Tip>
**Domain Pricing:** Research competitor pricing for each TLD. Price popular TLDs (.com, .net) competitively. Add higher margins to premium TLDs (.io, .ai). Set renewals 10-20% higher than registration.
</Tip>
