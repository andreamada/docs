title: "Configuring Packages"
description: "Packages are basically products or plans. Packages can appear on order forms and be ordered by clients, or added manually by staff. An ordered package becomes a service, which may or may not recur, depending on the pricing option selected. A recurring service results in recurring invoices being generated for the renewal period."
