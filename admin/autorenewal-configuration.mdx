## Website Auto-Renewal

Enable automatic renewal for hosting packages to maintain continuous service.

**Enable/Disable:** Master toggle for automatic website renewal

**How Website Auto-Renewal Works:**
1. System detects upcoming expiration (7-14 days before)
2. Automatic payment processed using saved payment method
3. If successful, website renewed for next billing period
4. Customer receives confirmation email with new expiration date
5. Service continues without interruption

| Setting | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-Renewal** | Enabled |
| **Renewal Notice** | 7-14 days before |
| **Retry Failed Payments** | Yes |
| **Retry Attempts** | 2-3 times |
| **Retry Interval** | 2-3 days |

<Tip>
**Benefits:** Auto-renewal reduces customer churn, ensures continuous service delivery, and provides predictable recurring revenue. Most customers prefer the convenience of automatic renewal.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Customer Control:** Customers can opt-out of auto-renewal at any time from their account settings. Always respect customer preferences and send clear notifications before charging.
</Info>

## Domain Auto-Renewal

Enable automatic renewal for domain registrations to prevent domain loss.

**Enable/Disable:** Master toggle for automatic domain renewal

**How Domain Auto-Renewal Works:**
1. System detects upcoming expiration (30 days before)
2. Automatic payment processed using saved payment method
3. Domain renewed through registrar API (e.g., Dynadot)
4. Customer receives confirmation with new expiration date
5. Domain remains active and under customer control

| Setting | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-Renewal** | Enabled |
| **Renewal Notice** | 30 days before |
| **Early Renewal** | 7-14 days before expiration |
| **Grace Period** | 30 days after expiration |
| **Retry Failed Payments** | Yes |

<Warning>
**Domain Expiration Risks:**
- Expired domains may be lost permanently
- Domain can be registered by someone else
- Email and website services stop immediately
- Recovery can be expensive or impossible

**Always enable auto-renewal for critical domains and send multiple reminders!**
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Early Renewal:** Renew domains 7-14 days before expiration to avoid last-minute issues. This provides a buffer for payment failures and ensures domains never lapse.
</Tip>

## Renewal Notifications

Configure when customers receive renewal reminder emails.

**Website Renewal Reminders:**
- 30 days before: First reminder
- 14 days before: Second reminder
- 7 days before: Final reminder
- Day of expiration: Urgent notice

**Domain Renewal Reminders:**
- 60 days before: Early notice
- 30 days before: First reminder
- 14 days before: Second reminder
- 7 days before: Final reminder
- Day of expiration: Urgent notice

**Each reminder includes:**
- Service name and details
- Expiration date
- Renewal amount
- Payment method on file
- Link to manage auto-renewal settings

<Info>
**Notification Strategy:** Multiple reminders ensure customers are aware of upcoming renewals. Early notices give customers time to update payment methods or cancel if needed.
</Info>

## Payment Processing

Configure how automatic payments are processed for renewals.

**Supported for Auto-Renewal:**
- Credit/Debit Cards (via Stripe)
- PayPal (with billing agreement)
- Saved payment methods

**Not Supported:**
- Bank transfers (manual only)
- Cash payments
- One-time payment methods

### Failed Payment Handling

**Retry Process:**

1. Initial payment attempt fails
2. Customer receives immediate notification email
3. System retries payment after 2-3 days
4. Multiple retry attempts (up to 3) over 7-10 days
5. If all attempts fail, send final notice
6. Grace period allows time for manual payment

| Setting | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| **Retry Attempts** | 3 times |
| **First Retry** | 2 days after failure |
| **Second Retry** | 5 days after failure |
| **Third Retry** | 7 days after failure |
| **Grace Period** | 7-14 days after final failure |

<Warning>
**Payment Failures:** Common causes include expired cards, insufficient funds, or cancelled payment methods. Always notify customers immediately when payments fail and provide easy ways to update payment information.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Reduce Failures:** Send card expiration reminders 30 days before cards expire. Encourage customers to keep payment methods up-to-date. Offer multiple payment options for flexibility.
</Tip>
