## Cron Automation

Configure automated tasks to run on a schedule, improving efficiency and reducing manual work.

### What is Cron Automation?

Cron automation allows you to schedule recurring tasks that run automatically at specified intervals. This is essential for database cleanup, email notifications, report generation, and data synchronization.

**Setting Up Cron Jobs:**

1. Copy the cron endpoint URL from the Cron Automation tab
2. Log in to your server's control panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)
3. Add a new cron job with the URL you copied
4. Configure how often the cron should run (e.g., every hour, daily)
5. Verify the cron job runs successfully

<Info>
**Recommended Schedule:** Run cron jobs every 5-15 minutes for optimal performance. Adjust based on your specific needs and server resources.
</Info>

<Tip>
Start with a longer interval (e.g., hourly) and adjust as needed. Monitor server resources to ensure cron jobs don't overload your system. Set up logging to track cron job execution and errors.
</Tip>
